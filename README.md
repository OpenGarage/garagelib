# garagelib

garagelib is the library for OpenGarage used for controlling both Security+ 1.0 and 2.0 openers. The library is written from the work of [ratgdo](https://github.com/PaulWieland/ratgdo) and [gdolib](https://github.com/konnected-io/gdolib/blob/master/gdo.c) for Arduino. The encoding and decoding comes from the [secplus](https://github.com/argilo/secplus) library which the c files are added to the source tree to allow it to work as an Arduino library.

## Status

Currently garagelib only supports opening and closing the garage door, getting its status, and controlling lights. More feature support might be added in the future.
